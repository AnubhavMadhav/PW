 Here are some of the key components and functionality you would need:

- User Authentication: Users should be able to create an account or login using their contact number. The system should securely store user credentials and protect sensitive information such as passwords.

- Product Catalog: The system should provide a searchable and filterable product catalog that displays relevant product information, such as product name, price, images, and descriptions.

- Cart System: Users should be able to add items to their shopping cart, view their cart contents, and modify their cart items (e.g. update quantity or remove items).

- Checkout: Users should be able to securely checkout their cart items and complete the payment process. The checkout process should include billing and shipping information, payment method selection, and order confirmation.

- Order Management: The system should provide an order management system that allows users to view their order history, track order status, and manage returns and cancellations.

- Product Reviews and Ratings: Users should be able to leave reviews and ratings for products they have purchased. This will help other customers make informed purchasing decisions.

- Wishlist: Users should be able to add products to their wishlist for later purchase. The wishlist should be accessible from the user's account and allow them to easily move wishlist items to their cart.

- User Account Management: Users should be able to manage their account information, such as contact details, shipping addresses, and payment methods.

- Customer Support: The system should provide customer support features such as a help desk or chat system, to help users with any issues they encounter.

- These are just some of the features and functionality that a complete e-commerce system might include. Designing and implementing a full-featured e-commerce system can be a complex undertaking, but by breaking down the system into smaller, more manageable components, it becomes more feasible.

    An overview of how a polling system like Telegram with multiple options and live vote count might work. Here are some of the key components and functionality you would need:

1. Create Poll: Users should be able to create a new poll by entering a question and multiple answer options. Each answer option should have a unique identifier (e.g. A, B, C) that users can select when voting.

2. Vote: Users should be able to select one answer option from the list and submit their vote. Users should not be allowed to vote multiple times on the same poll.

3. Vote Count: The system should keep track of the number of votes received for each answer option and display the live vote count to users. Users should be able to see the percentage of total votes that each answer option has received.

4. Poll Results: Once a user has voted, the system should display the poll results with the live vote count. Users should be able to see how their vote compares to the overall vote count and how other users have voted.

5. Timer: Users should be given a specific amount of time to vote on a poll. The system should display a timer that counts down the remaining time until the poll closes.

6. Notifications: Users should be notified when a new poll is created, when a poll they have voted on is closed, and when the final results are available.

7. User Management: Users should be able to manage their account information, such as contact details and notification settings.
